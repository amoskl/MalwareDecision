The Decision Tree (decisiontree.py) is built using the 'scikit-learn' package, also referred to as 'sklearn'.
In order to install scikit-learn, the 'numpy' and 'scipy' modules are also needed.

The URL for the scikit-learn package website is http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
Installation instructions can be found here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

And this is the documentation for the package: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html

I personally did not manage to install it on Windows 64-bit.
